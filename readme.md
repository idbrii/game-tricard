# Tricard

The pitch: a card battler where the cards are triangular and each corner has a
number that modifies the action of the card. When played, that corner gets torn
and can't be used, but once you've torn all three the card gets upgraded and
corners restored. Figure out how to best apply small and big damage effects to
upgrade quickly to put out massive damage.
